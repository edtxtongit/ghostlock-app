# Kernel Profile Porting Guide

This guide explains how to make GhostLock support a new kernel.

GhostLock matches kernels by exact `uname -r`. When nothing matches, the app
refuses to run. In most cases you don't need to change code — you only add a
profile (a HOCON config file) for that kernel.

> Only kernel geometry (symbol and struct offsets) is required.
> `recommend_shizuku` and the retry/wait values under `execution` are
> suggestions: a profile may omit them, and the shipped default becomes the
> suggestion (see [Shared Execution Defaults](defaults.md)).

## Before you start

- A target device reachable over `adb`, or a firmware package matching it.
- A working build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` succeeds.
- The extraction tool builds ([`tools/extract_rs`](../../tools/extract_rs), Rust).

## Where the files live

Every built-in profile lives in `app/src/main/assets/kernel_profiles/`:

- `index.conf` — the list of built-in kernels. New profiles must be added here.
- `<uname-r>.conf` — one complete profile per kernel; the file name must match
  `uname -r` exactly.
- `execution-tuning.conf` — tuning shared by every kernel.
- `execution-<route>.conf` — tuning for a single execution route. The resolver
  loads these presets; device profiles don't `include` them.
- `credential-6x.conf`, `kernelsnitch-6x.conf` — cred template and
  KernelSnitch values shared by 6.x kernels.
- `*-template.conf` — annotated reference templates. You can load them manually
  from the debug page, but they never participate in device matching.
- `docs/kernel_profiles/templates/` — templates grouped by kernel family.

All of these are parsed as HOCON (Typesafe Config): `#` comments, `${?variables}`,
trailing commas, and `include "file.conf"` (relative to the same directory,
nestable) are supported. JSON is still valid HOCON, so nothing needs converting.

For what each field means, the required-field matrix, and the validation rules,
see the [Profile schema](PROFILE_SCHEMA.md). This guide covers the workflow only
and doesn't repeat the field reference.

## Adaptation steps

1. **Identify the kernel version.**
   Run `adb shell uname -r` and keep the complete string; any character
   difference makes matching fail.

2. **Pick a template.**
   Open the document for the kernel family:
   [5.x](templates/kernel-5.x.template.md),
   [6.1](templates/kernel-6.1.template.md),
   [6.6](templates/kernel-6.6.template.md),
   [6.12](templates/kernel-6.12.template.md).

3. **Copy it into a new profile.**
   Copy the template to `app/src/main/assets/kernel_profiles/<uname-r>.conf`.
   The file name must match `release`, then fill in the required fields.

4. **Extract the offsets.**
   Build and run the extractor:

   ```sh
   (cd tools/extract_rs && cargo build --release)
   build/extract/release/ghostlock-extract boot.img --format conf --out profile.conf
   ```

   `--format conf` writes a flattened, self-contained profile (no `include`
   lines, the 6.x cred/KernelSnitch constants inlined) with every field
   the image actually yields and the rest omitted; it never fills gaps from a
   neighbouring kernel family's guesses. Treat it as a **candidate seed**: it
   can start the new profile directly, but the app validates missing fields
   after import and blocks execution, so a successful generation does not mean
   the profile is usable. On 5.x it also derives the cred reference
   repair and the multicast geometry from the image and its BTF. The tool accepts a `boot.img` (optionally with
   `xbl_config.img`), a complete OTA zip, or an `http(s)` URL pointing at one.
   Pass `--kallsyms` to supply a symbol table explicitly, or omit it to recover
   the image's embedded table. `pselect_waiter_shift` and
   `off_slide_loggers_0_1` are derived by the built-in arm64 disassembler, and
   the route is suggested from kernel evidence (`--route` overrides it).
   MediaTek images have no `xbl_config.img` and usually no embedded BTF: the
   physical load address is derived from kallsyms `_text`, and you can override
   it with `--phys`.

5. **Transcribe field by field, then check your work.**
   Field meanings and requirements are in the
   [Profile schema](PROFILE_SCHEMA.md). Confirm every required `off_*` is
   non-zero and that the task/cred layout comes from the same image. Set
   `recommend_shizuku` as needed (default `0`; only the 5.15 multicast profile
   recommends it).

6. **Change `execution` only with device evidence.**
   Otherwise keep the [Shared Defaults](defaults.md). You can also try values on the
   in-app parameter override page first (see below) before writing them back.

7. **Register it in `index.conf`.**
   Add a `{release, file}` entry, then validate and build:

   ```sh
   jq . app/src/main/assets/kernel_profiles/index.conf
   (cd tools/extract_rs && cargo test)
   ./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug
   ```

8. **Verify on a real device.**
   Install with `./gradlew installDebug` and test repeatedly in the same
   environment, on fixed cores, with a single execution route. Let the device cool
   down first so CPU throttling doesn't skew the results. Don't mark a new
   profile as "supported" until it passes on-device verification.

## Editing configuration inside the app

You don't have to edit assets and reinstall the app for every tweak. The app
offers two override layers; saving applies them immediately and they take part
in the next run:

- **Parameter override page (general overrides)** - adjust `execution.*` tuning,
  such as attempt counts, wait/timeout values, and core selection.
- **Advanced override page** - change `route` / `fallback.to` and any numeric
  path (stored as sparse HOCON); handy for trying new offsets or geometry.
- **Export config** - write the fully merged HOCON to a folder you pick (SAF)
  and use it as the starting point for a new profile.

Overrides are saved per release and take priority over the built-in profile and
imported offsets. See section 7 of the
[Profile schema](PROFILE_SCHEMA.md) for the layer order and storage locations.
Adding a kernel to the built-in set still follows the steps above and commits to
assets.


## Safety notes

- `off_* = 0` in a template is a symbol offset relative to the kernel image
  base; you must extract the real value.
- A wrong task/cred/multicast layout can destabilize the kernel, blank
  the screen, or reboot the device.
- Raising `execution` attempt counts or shortening waits increases heat and can
  lower the success rate.
- Don't submit a new profile as "supported" before it passes on-device
  verification.
